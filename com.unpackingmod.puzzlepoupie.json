With such a wide range of people playing video games these days, it can be tough for them to find a balance that satisfies both casual gamers who would like a breakdown of what to do and hardcore gamers who would rather learn the mechanics naturally. Either way, a game will ideally be able to teach players its mechanics without forcing them to read any immersion-breaking pop-ups."

This is, of course, on the short side, though this isnt necessarily a bad thing, as many games often suffer from overstaying their welcome, Although 3 hours is a decent length for the story of Unpacking, it may have been nice to have had some bonus levels, which could have been separate from the main story and perhaps leaned into the puzzle aspect of the game by offering harder stages.."
